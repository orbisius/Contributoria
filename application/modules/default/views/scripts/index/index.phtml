<h1>Hello World!</h1>

<p>'The job is never finished," said Tony Blair in an interview last month, and now we know what he means.</p>

<p>A few years ago, Blair seemed to have all but disappeared into a world of distant diplomacy, lucrative business consultancy and dealings with questionable regimes: a man forever sitting in some international departure lounge, with much more on his mind than the small change of British politics.</p>

<p>But now look. Over the past month or so, by way of marking the fifth anniversary of his exit from Downing Street, he has sat for three revealing interviews, and served notice that he wants to somehow be freshly involved in domestic affairs. He popped up at a Labour fundraising dinner at Arsenal's Emirates stadium, where tickets were £500 a head. He was greeted by the obligatory crowd of protesters, still furious about his role in the Iraq war – but his presence lent the event enough pizzazz to raise what Labour insiders call "a substantial six-figure sum", and some whispers claim was as much as £500,000.</p>

<p>The following day, it was announced that he had been recruited to Labour's policy review, advising shadow ministers on the legacy of the London Olympics. On the face of it, this was a rum turn: a man once in charge of the most grave affairs of state, reduced to thinking about what to do with a cluster of expensive architecture in east London, and the immediate future of school sport. But as far as the press were concerned, the details were less important than the obvious symbolism: "Look who's come back! Tony Blair's new job with Labour as he shares stage with Ed Miliband" was the headline in the Daily Mail; "Meet the new Labour adviser: Tony Blair," said the Guardian.</p>

<p>Taking soundings from Labour high-ups, one gets the sense of cold water being poured on the more excited accounts of the ex-leader's return: Blair is not about to start attending shadow cabinet meetings, or preparing for a role as and when Ed Miliband makes it to Downing Street.</p>

<p>"There's not more to this than meets the eye," insists an insider close to the current leader, though the same source acknowledges the media oomph of Blair's modest political comeback. Miliband's mission, he says, is not just to restore Labour's sense of purpose, but "put the family back together" – and bringing Blair in from the cold is all part of the script. There are also rumblings about Blair wanting to patch up his relationship with the party he can still offend to its core – as happened when he published his autobiography, whose infamous final chapter found him making supportive noises about the coalition, and appearing to endorse its stringent brand of austerity.</p>

<p>Though Miliband won the leadership by defining himself against New Labour, senior party figures insist that there is at least some of the Blair manual that remains in place: the importance of unity, the fact that "different times always require different solutions", and the self-evident importance of winning elections. Such, it seems, are the semiotics of the widely circulated photograph taken last week, in which Blair and Miliband posed with their wives for a picture that was meant to convey common cause, but could not quite disguise an inescapable sense of unease (not least on the face of Cherie Blair, who wore the kind of stick-on smile one would expect to see at a bad wedding reception).</p>
